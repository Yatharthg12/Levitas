# LEVITAS 
**LEVITation via Active Stabilization**

## Overview
LEVITAS investigates **active magnetic levitation using feedback control**, aiming to enable **contactless, vibration-free containment** of objects inside a controlled chamber. Unlike passive magnetic levitation systems, which are fundamentally unstable, LEVITAS relies on **real-time sensing and electromagnetic actuation** to dynamically stabilize a levitated object.

The long-term vision is a **Magnetically Levitated Processing Chamber (MLPC)** for ultra-precision manufacturing, measurement, and handling applications where mechanical contact introduces contamination, stress, or vibration.

This repository begins with a **physics-grounded simulation** of a one-dimensional active magnetic levitation system.

## Motivation
Modern high-precision manufacturing domains (e.g., semiconductor fabrication, quantum hardware, biomedical devices) are increasingly constrained by:
- Mechanical contact and wear
- Particulate contamination
- Micro-vibrations and induced stress

A contactless levitation environment can mitigate these limitations. However, **static magnetic levitation is provably unstable** under classical electromagnetism (Earnshaw’s Theorem). Stable levitation therefore requires **active feedback control**, which is the core principle explored in this project.

---

## Phase 1 Scope
Phase 1 focuses on:
- Physical modeling of magnetic levitation
- Mathematical formulation of system dynamics
- Open-loop instability demonstration
- Closed-loop stabilization using feedback control

No hardware assumptions are made at this stage.

---

## Physical System Description
The modeled system consists of:
- A single object of mass \( m \), constrained to vertical motion
- Gravity acting downward
- An electromagnet positioned above the object
- A position sensor measuring object height
- A controller that adjusts electromagnet current in real time

The objective is to **maintain the object at a desired height without mechanical contact**.

## Mathematical Model

### Magnetic Force Approximation
The magnetic force generated by the electromagnet is approximated as:

\[
F_m(x, i) = \frac{k \, i^2}{x^2}
\]

where:
- \( x \) is the distance between the magnet and the object  
- \( i \) is the coil current  
- \( k \) is a lumped constant capturing magnetic geometry and material properties  

This nonlinear inverse-square model captures the essential instability and control behavior of magnetic levitation systems.

---

### Equation of Motion
The vertical motion of the object is governed by:

\[
m\ddot{x} = F_m(x, i) - mg
\]

where \( g \) is gravitational acceleration.

---

### State-Space Representation
Define the state variables:
\[
x_1 = x \quad \text{(position)}
\]
\[
x_2 = \dot{x} \quad \text{(velocity)}
\]

Then:
\[
\dot{x}_1 = x_2
\]
\[
\dot{x}_2 = \frac{k i^2}{m x_1^2} - g
\]

This system is **nonlinear and open-loop unstable**.

---

## Control Principle
Because passive magnetic forces cannot produce stable equilibrium, LEVITAS employs **active feedback control**.

The control input modifies the coil current:
\[
i(t) = i_0 + u(t)
\]

A proportional-derivative (PD) controller is initially used:
\[
u(t) = K_p(x_{ref} - x) - K_d\dot{x}
\]

This enables stabilization around a desired height while providing insight into oscillations, sensitivity, and system limitations.

---

## Key Insight
**Stability in magnetic levitation arises from active feedback control, not from static magnetic fields.**

LEVITAS demonstrates how software-defined control transforms an inherently unstable physical system into a controllable one.
